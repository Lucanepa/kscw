# KSCW Project

## Infrastructure
All infrastructure details (IPs, URLs, ports, credentials, deploy commands) are in **INFRA.md**. Always consult it before making infrastructure-related changes or when you need connection details.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS
- Backend: PocketBase (SQLite, REST API, Realtime, Auth)
- Hosting: Cloudflare Pages (frontend), Synology NAS + Cloudflare Tunnel (backend)
- Language: German UI (Swiss German context), code in English

## Key Patterns
- PocketBase hooks use isolated scopes — shared code must use `require(__hooks + "/file.js")` with `module.exports`
- `pb_hooks/` is gitignored (contains API keys) — deployed separately via SSH/rsync
- `.env` is gitignored — Cloudflare Pages env vars handle production config

## Branches
- `main` → production (`kscw.lucanepa.com`)
- `dev` → preview (`dev-kscw.lucanepa.com`)
